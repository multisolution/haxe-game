# HaxeGame

Playing with [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), [OpenFl](http://www.openfl.org/) and [Nape](http://napephys.com/).

## NTS
- It's boring, yet very illustrative to handle a link between Nape and OpenFl
- It's very hard to manage DPI scale
- Definitely, for a production work, it worth to use a renderer like HaxeFlixel or HaxePunk
