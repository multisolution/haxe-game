# HaxeGame

Playing with [Haxe](https://haxe.org/), [OpenFl](http://www.openfl.org/) and [Nape](http://napephys.com/).

## NTS
- Missing something to globally handle collisions, maybe a `InteractionManager` what would avoid custom events like `PlayerEvent` and handling `Enemy` collisions to the `Wall` inside the `Player`
- It's boring, yet very illustrative to handle a link between Nape and OpenFl
- Definitely, for a production work, it worth to use a renderer like HaxeFlixel or HaxePunk
- <strike>It's very hard to manage DPI scale</strike>

## Gave up DPI scale management

Actually, it doesn't makes sense to build a fluid layout game since players will, at least in this case, see distinct level widths which direct impacts gameplay. So we're defining `360x640` as the logical resolution, which has a 9:16 aspect ratio (or a portrait 16:9) and let it fit into the available space.

The main ideia is a **8-bit**, e.g.:
